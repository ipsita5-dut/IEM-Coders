First of all, we are very delighted for being able to work on this project with so many awesome mentors helping us 24 hours. With this initail thanksgiving to Jadavpur Double Slash 3.0 hackathon organizers
and the mentors we would like to share our Project Idea with you all.

MISSION:
  Everyday there are millions of customers buying so many products from E-Commerce websites like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Walmart etc. Wouldn't it be cool if we could give the buyers a brief overview
of the price comparision of the product by giving them the Current price, Highest price and Cheapest price so far that were available in that website. Thats what we thought of creating within our web application.
It will give them all price ranges from lowest to highest that were given so far for the products on the website through WEB-SCRAPPING. We used BrightData website to do the web scrapping and aquire the data.
As we are students so within the free version of the BrightData for now we could only tally the previous highest and lowest prices of the products on Amazon.
       FUTURE SCOPE:-
       In future we intend to introduce ML in our project so that it can predict the possible price shift of a given product within 7~30 days. We also intend to increase the possible websites from which we can scrap the data and recommend the user to buy from which website based on the situation.

VISION:
The already existing Extensions which also work in a kind of similar way, their full potential are somehow locked behind paid ownership of those extensions. Our long term vision is to break these money hungry boundaries to reach to every possible user possible with the help of open source platform collaborations. The benifit of checking price of a product in different websites should be a leverage anyone can have.
This project aims to fulfill that.

CURRENT WEAKNESS:
  As there are many extensions available that users can use within their browser to do similar kind of analysis (even though for premium users), as it provides better functionality currently than our website. it makes the user less inclined towards using our website. 
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
